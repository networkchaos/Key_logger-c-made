Algorith for writing a simple keylogger
//create an empty log file for storing keylogs
//intercept keys pressed by the user
using GetAsynKeyState() function.
//store these intercepted values in file.
//hide the running windows diolog to make it undetectable
//use the while looping to make it run in all condiions.
//Add SLeep() function to reduce the CPU usage to 0%.
